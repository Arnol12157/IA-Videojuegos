    /// The method to be called on recognition event
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="r">Recognition result</param>
    /// 
    /// <remarks>
    /// Implement your own method here. This method will be called by GestureBehaviour
    /// automatically when a gesture is recognized. You can write your own script
    /// in this method (kill enemies, shoot a fireball, or cast some spell etc.)
    /// This method's signature should match the signature of OnRecognition event,
    /// so your method should always have one parametre with the type of Result. Example:
    /// 
    /// void MyMethod(Result gestureResult) {
    ///     kill enemy,
    ///     shoot fireball,
    ///     cast spell etc.
    /// }
    /// 
    /// You can decide what to do depending on the name of the gesture and its score.
    /// For example, let's say, if the player draws the letter of "e" (let's name the 
    /// gesture "Fireball") and it is 50% similar to our "Fireball" gesture, shoot a fireball:
    /// 
    /// void MagicHandler(Result magicGesture) {
    /// 
    ///    if (magicGesture.Name == "Fireball" && magicGesture.Score >= 0.5f) {
    ///        Instantiate(fireball, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);
    ///    }
    /// 
    /// }
    /// 
    /// !: You can name this method whatever you want, but you should use the same name
    /// when subscribing and unsubscribing. If your method's name is MagicHandler like above,
    /// then:
    /// 
    /// void OnEnable() {
    ///   GestureBehaviour.OnRecognition += MagicHandler;
    /// }
    /// </remarks>
    void OnGestureRecognition(Result r) {
        SetMessage("Gesture is recognized as <color=#ff0000>'" + r.Name + "'</color> with a score of " + r.Score);
